Hello World!

As a Software Engineer, I have to start everything with a "Hello World!" project. And this post is my saying Hello world to the blogging.

I had many blogs before in many platforms like: Blogger and WordPress but I didn't find them engaging. So, I started to look into a new platform and here I am!
I chose GitHub Pages after the encouraging from my [Readify](http://www.Readify.net) colleague friend [Gian](http://gianlorenzetto.github.io/). Thanks my friend for the support :)

Now, I will create the next post to tell my story with the set up. Stay Tuned!
